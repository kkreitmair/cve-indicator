A Tool, for indicating if there is a CVE related to an openwrt package.
cve-indicator uses the 
`cve-search <https://www.circl.lu/services/cve-search/>`_ database API to 
fulfil his tasks.

Installtion
===========

For the installation is needed:
  * pip3
  * pipenv
  * git

Installation procedure::

  $ git clone git@github.com:kkreitmair/cve-indicator.git
  $ cd cve-indicator
  $ pipenv install

Usage
=====

Enter the tool environment with the command **pipenv shell**. After this, 
the following commands are available.

Usage commandline tool::

  $ cve-indicator gen-list <project> <path>
  $ cve-indicator get-cves <path to gen-list report> [--api_url API_URL]
  $ cve-indicator gen-rprt <path to get-cves report>

Currently only the project openwrt is supported.
Path specifies the directory of the finished openwrt build, where all 
Manifestfiles are included. The first command will genarate a report in JSON 
format. This report is used by the second command.

The second command needs a API URL specified. This can happen through giving 
it with the **--api_url** parameter or over the config file in yaml format.

Example of an config file::

  get-cves:
    api_url: http://cve.circl.lu/api/cvefor/

The second command will also generate a report in JSON format. This report can 
be used to generate a HTML report with the third command.
